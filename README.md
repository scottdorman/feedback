# scottdorman/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything (ama) type of repository.

It's a blatant rip-off of [haacked/feedback](https://github.com/haacked/feedback), which is itself a blatant rip-off of [holman/ama](https://github.com/holman/ama). But good ideas are meant to be spread.

I like to write about software, open source, .NET, and other random topics at http://scottdorman.github.io/. If you have a comment or an issue on a specific blog post, please use [that repository](https://github.com/scottdorman/scottdorman.github.io/issues/new) instead.

If you have any other questions about any of those topics or me, feel free to ask it here.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/scottdorman/scottdorman.github.io/issues/new) on this repository.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/scottdorman/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@sdorman](https://twitter.com/sdorman) on Twitter.
